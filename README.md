# Dataforest Test Tasks

This repository contains solutions for the Dataforest test tasks. Each task is placed in a separate branch.

## Task 1: Scraping Products from Vendr

There are two versions of the solution for Task 1. One focuses only on the main categories, while the other one collects data from both main categories and their subcategories.

### Version 1: Scraping Only Main Categories
- This version collects product data from three main categories: **DevOps**, **IT Infrastructure**, and **Data Analytics and Management**.


### Version 2: Scraping Main Categories and Subcategories
- This version collects data not only from the main categories but also from the **subcategories** found within each of the main categories.
- It follows links to subcategories labeled "View more" on the category page and scrapes product data from those as well.
